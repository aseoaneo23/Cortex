# Project Governance

## Roles

* **Maintainers**: Responsible for maintaining the codebase and the overall project direction.
* **Contributors**: Anyone who contributes to the project through code, documentation, or other means.
* **Community Members**: Anyone who uses, tests, or participates in the project’s community.

## Decision-Making

Decisions are made following a consensus-based model. We strive for consensus among maintainers for all final decisions. 
In case of persistent disagreement, the founding maintainer has the final say.

Maintainers will prioritize:
1. Stability of the core features.
2. Code quality and documentation.
3. User experience and privacy.

Maintainers are expected to follow the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
